const COIN_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  PAXG:   'PAXG is a gold-backed digital token where each coin represents one troy ounce of investment-grade London Good Delivery gold held in Brink\'s vaults in London, redeemable for physical gold or fiat currency.',
  BTC:    'Bitcoin (BTC) is the original and most widely used cryptocurrency \u2014 its primary value is as a long-term store of value rather than everyday spending. It\'s the most liquid and widely accepted crypto, which lowers risk relative to other coins, but its price is still highly volatile and it offers no yield or income on its own.',
  BCH:    'Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin designed for everyday transactions rather than as a store of value. It has a smaller network and lower adoption than Bitcoin, which makes it more volatile and less liquid. Best suited for buyers who believe in crypto as a payment currency rather than an investment asset.',
  AAVE:   'Aave (AAVE) is a decentralized lending protocol \u2014 you can deposit crypto to earn interest or borrow against your holdings without a bank. AAVE as a token gives you governance rights over the protocol. The appeal is the ability to put your crypto to work earning yield, but it carries smart contract risk (code vulnerabilities) and the value of AAVE itself is tied directly to how much activity the protocol sees.',
  SOL:    'Solana (SOL) is built for speed and low transaction costs, handling thousands of transactions per second compared to Ethereum\'s slower throughput \u2014 making it attractive for apps, gaming, and payments. The tradeoff is that Solana has experienced network outages in the past, and its validator set is more centralized than Ethereum or Bitcoin, which is a risk factor for long-term buyers.',
  QNT:    'Quant (QNT) is a utility-based, enterprise and institutional-facing coin \u2014 its value is tied to adoption of Overledger (a platform designed to expedite digital exchange with simplicity and security) by banks, governments, and large corporations to connect different blockchains together. It has an extremely small max supply of only 14.6 million tokens ever, which amplifies price movement in both directions. It\'s a higher-conviction, niche bet on blockchain becoming standard infrastructure for financial institutions.',
  LTC:    'Litecoin (LTC) is one of the oldest and most battle-tested cryptocurrencies, functioning as a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin for payments. It has a long track record and solid liquidity, but limited innovation or unique use cases compared to newer coins, making it lower risk but also lower upside relative to others on this list.',
  LINK:   'Chainlink (LINK) is infrastructure \u2014 it\'s the bridge that feeds real-world data into blockchain smart contracts, making it essential to the functioning of most DeFi applications. Its value is tied to how widely smart contracts are used across all blockchains, not just one. The risk is that it\'s a utility token, so its price is driven more by developer adoption than retail speculation.',
  UNI:    'Uniswap (UNI) is the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, this service allows users to swap any token (ERC-20) directly from their wallet for a trading fee and a gas fee. Uniswap is a governance token that gives holders voting rights. The funds received from trading fees are dispersed to members who participate in their liquidity pools.',
  TRUMP:  'Official Trump (TRUMP) is a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain on January 17, 2025, three days before Trump\'s inauguration. It has no utility, underlying asset, or technology backing its value \u2014 it is purely driven by political sentiment, celebrity association, and speculation. 80% of the total 1 billion token supply is controlled by two Trump-affiliated entities and is being gradually released over three years, meaning insiders hold the overwhelming majority. It peaked at $75 shortly after launch and has since fallen over 95% to around $3. A forensic analysis found that 764,000 wallets lost money trading it while a small number of insiders profited significantly. It has no hard cap utility, no governance rights, no yield, and no physical backing \u2014 making it the highest risk asset on this list.',
  ADI:    'ADI is a utility token that is financed by transactional movement conducted on the ADI platform.',
  ETH:    'Ethereum (ETH) is the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts \u2014 most DeFi apps, NFTs, and layer-2 networks are built on it. After switching to proof-of-stake, holders can stake ETH to earn ~3-4% APR. EIP-1559 burns a portion of every transaction fee, making ETH deflationary during high network activity. It\'s the second most established crypto after Bitcoin.',
  XRP:    'XRP is designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments and is used by financial institutions through RippleNet. Transactions settle in 3-5 seconds at a fraction of a cent. Its value is tied to institutional adoption for international money transfers. The SEC lawsuit (largely resolved in Ripple\'s favor) was a major overhang that has now cleared.',
  BNB:    'Binance Coin (BNB) is the native token of the Binance ecosystem \u2014 the world\'s largest crypto exchange. It\'s used for trading fee discounts, Binance Launchpool access, and gas fees on BNB Chain. Binance conducts quarterly burns to reduce supply toward a target of 100M tokens. Its value is directly tied to Binance\'s dominance in crypto trading.',
  ADA:    'Cardano (ADA) takes a research-driven, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development \u2014 slower to ship features but aims for academic rigor. It supports staking (~3-5% APR) with no lock-up period, meaning you can unstake anytime. Its ecosystem is smaller than Ethereum or Solana but growing, with a focus on real-world use cases in developing markets.',
  DOT:    'Polkadot (DOT) connects different blockchains together through its relay chain and parachain architecture, allowing them to share security and communicate. Staking yields are among the highest of major chains at 12-15% APR.',
  DOGE:   'Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke but became one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies thanks to its community and Elon Musk\'s endorsements. It has no hard cap \u2014 5 billion new coins are minted every year, creating constant inflation. It has no smart contracts, no DeFi ecosystem, and no staking \u2014 its value is purely driven by sentiment and cultural relevance.',
  AVAX:   'Avalanche (AVAX) is a high-speed layer-1 blockchain with sub-second finality, designed for DeFi and enterprise use. Its unique subnet architecture lets anyone create custom blockchains with their own rules. Staking yields ~8-9% APR. It competes directly with Ethereum and Solana for DeFi and gaming applications.',
  SHIB:   'Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme token that grew into an ecosystem with its own DEX (ShibaSwap), layer-2 chain (Shibarium), and metaverse project. The total supply is nearly 1 quadrillion tokens, though regular burns reduce it over time. It\'s highly speculative \u2014 value is driven almost entirely by community size and sentiment rather than utility.',
  ATOM:   'Cosmos (ATOM) is the "internet of blockchains" \u2014 it provides the infrastructure (IBC protocol) for independent blockchains to communicate and transfer assets between each other. Staking yields are high at 15-20% APR. Being a Cosmos staker also qualifies you for frequent airdrops from new chains launching in the ecosystem.',
  NEAR:   'NEAR Protocol is a layer-1 blockchain focused on usability \u2014 it features human-readable account names instead of long wallet addresses and uses sharding to scale. Its developer experience is considered one of the best in crypto. Staking yields ~5-6% APR.',
  TRX:    'TRON (TRX) is a blockchain focused on entertainment and content sharing, with a large presence in Asia. It processes more USDT stablecoin transactions than any other chain. Staking yields ~4-5% APR. Its founder Justin Sun is a controversial figure, which adds reputational risk.',
  HBAR:   'Hedera (HBAR) uses hashgraph consensus instead of traditional blockchain \u2014 it\'s faster and more energy-efficient. Its governing council includes Google, IBM, Boeing, and other Fortune 500 companies. It\'s one of the most enterprise-focused cryptos, targeting real-world business use cases.',
  XLM:    'Stellar (XLM) focuses on connecting financial institutions and enabling low-cost cross-border payments, similar to XRP but with a non-profit foundation. It\'s used by companies like MoneyGram and IBM World Wire. Transaction fees are a fraction of a cent.',
  VET:    'VeChain (VET) specializes in supply chain management and business processes \u2014 tracking products from factory to consumer on the blockchain. Major partners include Walmart China, BMW, and DNV. Holding VET automatically generates VTHO tokens, which are used to pay for transactions.',
  ICP:    'Internet Computer (ICP) aims to host entire web applications and services on-chain \u2014 not just financial transactions but full websites, social media, and enterprise software. It\'s one of the most ambitious projects in crypto. Staking requires locking tokens in "neurons" for up to 8 years for maximum rewards.',
  FIL:    'Filecoin (FIL) is a decentralized storage network \u2014 users pay to store data across a global network of storage providers instead of relying on Amazon or Google. Storage providers earn FIL by proving they\'re reliably storing data. Its value is tied to the demand for decentralized, censorship-resistant data storage.',
  PEPE:   'PEPE is a meme coin based on the Pepe the Frog internet meme. It has no utility, no staking, no governance, and no backing \u2014 it is pure speculation driven by meme culture and social media momentum. The supply is 420.69 trillion tokens. It can gain or lose 50%+ in a single day.',
  MKR:    'Maker (MKR) governs the MakerDAO protocol, which issues DAI \u2014 one of the largest decentralized stablecoins. MKR holders vote on risk parameters like collateral types and stability fees. When the system runs a surplus, MKR is bought back and burned, making it deflationary. It\'s one of the oldest and most battle-tested DeFi protocols.',
  INJ:    'Injective (INJ) is a layer-1 blockchain optimized for DeFi \u2014 specifically decentralized derivatives, futures, and spot trading. It features a weekly burn auction that permanently removes INJ from supply. Staking yields are among the highest at 15-17% APR.',
  GRT:    'The Graph (GRT) is the indexing protocol for querying blockchain data \u2014 often called "the Google of blockchains." Developers use it to efficiently query data from Ethereum, NEAR, and other chains. Token holders can delegate GRT to indexers and earn ~10-12% APR.',
  RENDER: 'Render (RNDR) connects people who need GPU computing power (for 3D rendering, AI, etc.) with people who have idle GPUs. Node operators earn RENDER tokens for providing their computing power. Its value is tied to the growing demand for GPU compute in AI and creative industries.',

  STX:    'Stacks (STX) brings smart contracts and DeFi to Bitcoin through its unique "Stacking" mechanism \u2014 STX holders lock their tokens and earn yield paid in actual BTC, not STX. It\'s the leading project building programmability on top of Bitcoin\'s security.',
  ONDO:   'Ondo Finance (ONDO) tokenizes real-world assets like US Treasuries and bonds, bringing traditional finance yields on-chain. Its flagship product OUSG gives crypto holders exposure to short-term US government bonds. It bridges the gap between DeFi and traditional fixed-income investing.',
  PENDLE: 'Pendle (PENDLE) lets you tokenize and trade future yield \u2014 you can lock in a fixed yield rate or speculate on variable yields. It\'s one of the most innovative DeFi protocols, enabling yield trading strategies that previously only existed in traditional finance.',
  ENA:    'Ethena (ENA) created USDe, a synthetic dollar that generates yield through delta-neutral hedging strategies. Staking USDe (sUSDe) has offered 10-25% APR \u2014 far above traditional stablecoin yields. The high yields come from funding rate arbitrage, which carries smart contract and counterparty risk.',
  CRV:    'Curve (CRV) is the dominant DEX for stablecoin and pegged asset swaps, processing billions in volume. The "Curve Wars" \u2014 where protocols compete to direct CRV emissions \u2014 make it a central piece of DeFi infrastructure. Vote-locking CRV (veCRV) earns trading fees and governance power.',
